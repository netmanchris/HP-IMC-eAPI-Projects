#This series of functions is intended to help automate the build of an IMC server using
#the eAPI function. The eAPI is available natively on the IMC enterprise edition
#and can be added to the standard edition through the purchase of the eAPI addon license.

#This section imports required libraries
import requests, json, sys, time, subprocess, csv, os, ipaddress
from requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth


#url header to preprend on all IMC eAPI calls
url = None

#auth handler for eAPI calls
auth = None

#headers forcing IMC to respond with JSON content. XML content return is the default
headers = {'Accept': 'application/json', 'Content-Type': 'application/json','Accept-encoding': 'application/json'}



def get_custom_views():
    if auth == None or url == None:  # checks to see if the imc credentials are already available
        imc_creds()
    get_custom_view_url = '/imcrs/plat/res/view/custom?resPrivilegeFilter=false&desc=false&total=false'
    f_url = url + get_custom_view_url
    r = requests.get(f_url, auth=auth, headers=headers)   #creates the URL using the payload variable as the contents
